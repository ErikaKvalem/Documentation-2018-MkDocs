## 2.1 Introduction 

The main goal of this documentation is to introduce the reader into **electrophysiological (atrial) cell models**. 

Cardiac cells models in electrophysiology are *anatomic models* of the heart describing cardiac activity from sub-cellular and cellular level to the level of the whole organ. The models consist on a set of *ordinary differential equations* that describe the cell activity.
These are used in a wide range of applications from education and teaching, as for instance in cardiology, to development of diagnostic and therapeutic instrumentation, among other applications. 

These electrophysiologycal models have been developed throughout history since 1952. The first model was simulated by **Hodgkin-Huxley** on the axon membrane of a giant squid. Other important names have been for example **Noble**, **Beeler-Reuter**, **Luo-Rudy** etc.

## 2.2 The Hodgkin–Huxley model
By Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley (1952) 

Conductance-based model, is a mathematical model that describes how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated. It is a set of nonlinear differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of excitable cells and hence it is a continuous time model. This model is mentioned here so it basic for the understanding of more complex models. 

Hodgkin and Huxley found as a conclusion from the experiments performed on the giant axon of the squid three different types of ion current; sodium(Na+), potassium (K+), and a leak current that consists mainly of Chlorine ions. In the cell membrane, there are specific voltage-gated ion channels one for each type of ion mentioned before. The leak current includes other channel types. 

The semipermeable cell membrane separates the interior of the cell from the extracellular liquid and acts as a capacitor.  I(t)  is the input current injected into the cell. Each channel type is represented by a resistor. The diagonal arrow across the diagram of the resistor indicates that the value of the resistance is not fixed, but changes depending on whether the ion channel is open or closed. Because of active ion transport through the cell membrane, the ion concentration inside the cell is different from that in the extracellular liquid. [The Nernst potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nernst_equation) generated by the difference in ion concentration is represented by a battery. The Nernst potential is different for each ion type therefore there are separate batteries for each ion.
