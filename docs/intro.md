# 1. Introduction

The purpose of this documentation is to better understand simulations of atrial fibrilation. For this purpose cardiac cell models are run using **The fenics project** and **Cbcbeat** (**python**). 

This documentation will help to better understand hroguh step by step explanations, **how to perform the simulations**, going from atrial geometries to the simulation output. 

**Atrial fibrilation (AFib)**  is a  type of **supraventricular tachycardia**. It is a pathological state of the heart caused by irregular heartbeat of the atria. This causes the blood not to be moved effectely to the ventricles and therefore it can lead to **clots, strokes and heart failure**. **AFib** is the **most common abnormal heart rythm** affecting 2% of the population in Europe and North America. 

Since the mechanisms underlying **AFib** are poorly understood it is very helpful to use simulations based on **mathematical models** of the **cardiac cells** that will allow a better understanding of the process and eventually lead to new solutions for this pathology.
