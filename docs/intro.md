# 1. Introduction

This is a step by step explanation on how to install **The fenics project** and **cbcbeat** in Mac using **Docker**. 

The final aim of this whole process is to be able to use Fenics and cbcbeat to **run cell and 2D tissue simulations and visualize them.** 

For visualization **Paraview** and **OpenCOR** will be used. 


## Sections

- **Installation** step by step documentation for the set-up of fenics+cbcbeat on Mac using Docker.

- **Cell models** section electrophysiological Cell models are explained, both atrial and ventricular, from basic to more complex models. 

- **Tutorial** section two demos from **cbcbeat** can be found explained line by line

- **OpenCOR** three cell models are interpreted and visualized. 

- **Terminal code** process in the terminal used to install cbcbeat related to **Installation** section 





This documentation was developed by **Erika Kvalem Soto** in the context of a summer internship at **Simula Research Laboratory** with the supervision of **Valentina Carapella** as a contribution to the [**SysAFib**](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/sysafib-systems-medicine-diagnosis-and-stratification-atrial-fibrillation) project.
