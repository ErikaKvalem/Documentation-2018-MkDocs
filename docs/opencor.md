# 4.CellML models in OpenCOR 
For a better understanding of the models OpenCOR is used in order to visualize the behaviour of the different key parameters of the model.

## The Beeler Reuter model 

The following screenshot refers to the Beeler Reuter model run by OpenCOR. There are four plots regarding different parameters.

The first one shows the voltage dependence on time  V(t)  also known as action potential. In it can be distinguished the depolarization, plateau and repolarization phases of the action potentail of a cardiac cell. 

The second reffers to the fast inward current ($I_Na$).
